* Thinking sphinx - connector b/w sphinx and ActiveRecord
* Sphinx - Sphinx is a very fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways of searching it. Install Sphinx

* When indexing your data, Sphinx talks directly to your data source itself – which must be one of MySQL, PostgreSQL, or XML files

* Fields v/s Attributes
 - Fields are the content for your search queries
 - They are only string data – you could have numbers and dates and such in your fields, but Sphinx will only treat them as strings, nothing else.
 - No model methods

  - Attributes are used for sorting, filtering and grouping your search results.
  - They’re limited to the following data types: integers, floats, datetimes (as Unix timestamps – and thus integers anyway), booleans, and strings.
