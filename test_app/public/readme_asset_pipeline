# Framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets.
# It adds the ability to write these assets in other languages such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB.
# Fewer Requests faster application

#Turning of sprockets 
#config.assets.enabled = false
#rails new appname --skip-sprockets

# Concatenate
# One master file
# In production, Rails inserts an MD5 fingerprint into each filename so that the file is cached by the web browser

# Minification
# Removing whitespace

# What is Fingerprinting and Why Should I Care?
	# Change filename as per file content to encourage caching by browsers as a cache of file is maintained if the fingerprint is same
	# Rails using MD5 digest on contents - global-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.css
	# Earlier /stylesheets/global.css?1309495796
		#Not all caches will reliably cache content where the filename only differs by query parameters


#2 - Using Asset pipelines
# public directory - no compilation. in production converted to public/assets
# require_tree -code
# PreCompilation only in development not in production :P so you will get errors for .scss or .coffee

#2.1 - Disable generation of assets file ( application.rb) -code
#2.2 - Asset organization api
#2.2.1  Rails.application.config.assets.paths -code
# <%= image_tag "rails.png" %> - asset_path helper

#2.4 Manifests
#JS = //= require
#Css = /* *= require */
# Rails.application.config.assets.compress

#3 Development mode
#debug = false(separete asset file)

#4 Production mode
# config.assets.digest - FingerPrint
# config.assets.prefix - public/assets compiled assets

4.1 Precompiling assests
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
config.assets.initialize_on_precompile: false
